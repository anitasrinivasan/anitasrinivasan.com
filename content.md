I'm a lawyer and technologist who has spent the last decade working across corporate law, fintech, blockchain, and now AI governance.

I started my career as a corporate lawyer at **S&R Associates** in Mumbai, one of India's leading law firms, where I worked on public securities offerings and M&A transactions. That experience gave me a front-row seat to how capital markets and regulation shape technology adoption at scale.

I then moved into product management, joining **Kaleidofin**, a fintech startup in Chennai building financial products for underserved communities. Over four years, I helped scale mutual fund investments and credit underwriting models for microfinance borrowers from 4 to 500 branches across rural India and led policy advocacy around India's national digital identity infrastructure. At **Simpl**, I worked on regulatory strategy for a buy-now-pay-later business.

From 2023 to 2025, I served as **General Counsel at KGEN**, an onchain distribution protocol backed by Accel, Prosus, and Aptos. I led the legal, policy, and product counsel functions, negotiated a US$10 million strategic funding round, and developed the legal strategy for a token generation event and exchange listing across multiple jurisdictions.

I'm currently pursuing an **LL.M. at UC Berkeley School of Law** with a Certificate of Specialization in Law & Technology, graduating in May 2026. My coursework spans AI governance, securities regulation, antitrust, cybersecurity, and platform regulation.

At Berkeley, I'm a Research Fellow with the **Supervised Program for Alignment Research**, working on AI economic rights. I'm also a Graduate Student Researcher with Prof. Colleen Chien, building and researching technology-led approaches to scale access-to-justice initiatives through the **Paper Prisons Initiative**. I serve as Blog Editor at the **Berkeley Technology Law Journal** and am a board member of the **Berkeley AI Safety Initiative** and **AI at Berkeley Law**.

My writing on AI governance has appeared in **Tech Policy Press** and the **Berkeley Technology Law Journal Blog**, and has been featured in the **Financial Times**' FT Alphaville recommended reading list.
