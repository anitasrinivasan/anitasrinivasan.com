### Story

Watching my dad place stock-trading calls in the pre-internet era sparked a curiosity about markets that turned into:
- **Capital markets lawyering:** underwriter and company counsel on **US$1.78B** equity IPOs and placements in the financial-services and technology sector and diligence on the **US$23B Vodafone-Idea** telecom merger at S&R Associates (Aug 2015 ‚Äì Jun 2018).
- **Fintech product building:** re-architected Pay Later stack for regulatory resilience and piloted revenue-based financing for e-commerce merchants at Simpl (Jul 2022 ‚Äì Apr 2023); built inclusive-finance rails at Kaleidofin.
- **Web3 legal leadership:** steering Kratos‚Äô token launch and listing readiness, product advisory, fundraising (**US$10M** strategic ecosystem funding round) and corporate development (**US$4.3M** M&A deals).

Next stop: **Berkeley Law**, where I'll expand my playbook to cover governance and liability in decentralized technology and AI.
